# TriTag
Re-release of the abandoned software TriTag originally developed for Mac OS X by Patrick Gleichmann (FeedFace) during 2000 until 2004. The software depends on libid3tag.

A new release will be prepared for the current version of macOS.

## Description
TriTag helps you to get a clear MP3 collections by either creating a new filename out of the ID3 tag or filling the metatags using the information found in the filename using a user defined pattern -- easy due to a pattern builder. The first mode also allows to create a unique directory structure (artist/album/) similar to the one generated by iTunes "Consolidate library".
