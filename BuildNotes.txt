The reading of the tags is done by the "id3tag" library by Underbit.
Install it with
	
	fink install libid3tag

or grab the source:

	http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12349

The FreeDB is done with the "AGRegex" regular expression framework.
Get it at 

	http://sourceforge.net/projects/agkit/

and build it in the same parent directory as "src", e.g.

	TriTag/
		AGRegex/
		src/

Please note that if you build it by yourself than you have to correct
several paths in the project settings.
